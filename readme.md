## üí≠ What is Squiz?

Squiz is an API that allows to create and solve quizzes. These quizzes can be scheduled and defined to be answered within a specific range of time.
The API was built using the Django framework with help of the Graphene library to support GraphQL queries and mutations. It connects to a MySQL database by using the default ORM interface provided by Django.

## üìÅ Project structure

The API follows the default structure generated by Django, which separates the logic into the following "applications":

- ‚ùì **Quizzes**: Contains all the business logic related to the **main entities of the project**, which are: **quiz, question and option**.

<br>

- üë• **Users**: Contains all the business logic related to the **users** and the registration/authentication process to use the API.

<br>

- üìÖ **Scheduler**: Contains all the business logic related to the global **scheduler** of the app. The scheduler allows to automatically enable and disable quizzes based on their start and end time. It can also execute background time based tasks.


üìÅ In general, these applications share a well defined structure which is composed of the following sub-folders:

- **Migrations**: Contains auto-generated history files about the changes made to the database schema. These changes allow to build the DB in a fresh DBMS by executing the Django command `python3 manage.py migrate` (See more detail in the installation and execution section).

- **Mutators**: Contains the definition of the mutators that will be registered in the app. These mutators are then imported in the main GraphQL schema definition. 

- **Queries**: Similar to the mutators, this folder contains all the definition of the queries that can be used. They are also imported and registered in the main GraphQL schema object.

- **Tests**: This folder contains different tests related to its application.

üì∞ Also, the following files can be found in the applications folders:

- **Jobs**: Defines the jobs that will be added to the scheduler. They expose an `initial_jobs_config` variable containing the different jobs that should be registered. They can be of interval or time based types. The jobs get registered when the application gets executed.

- **Models**: Contains the ORM definition of the tables in the database. The classes allow to interact with the database by using the ORM interface.

- **Schema**: Contains the aggregation of all the queries and mutations of the application. It is a common file that gets imported and added to the core schema definition.

- **Utils**: Contains any kind of utility function related to the application.

- **Validators**: Contains validation functions that will run for specific database attributes when the ORM detects that data is being saved.
